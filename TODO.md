TODO:
- Content Security Policies? -> there is a netlify integration. needs further study (Marius)
- Set proper index behaviour for individual pages before go-live (Marius) (!!! WE SHOULD DO THIS AFTER WE ARE LIVE, OTHERWISE THE CONTENT UNDER THE BETA-URL WILL BE INDEX, RIGHT?)
- I removed `text-wrap: balance;` from LeadText. Ok with that? (Marius)

RIGHT AFTER GO LIVE:
- Remove no-index meta, set proper index
- Check Tracking integration for prod

OPTIONAL:
- form captcha?
- Color schema toggle?
- Custom Performance Marks?
- PWA?
- Share page button (Native API)?
- Store language and theme preference?

LATER:
- Cypress test for form submission
