      TODO We can offer a long lasting experience in building digital products.
      Over the course of our careers we have been working with many different
      technologies and frameworks. Still, we are great fans of the Web Standards.
      We have strong skills in CSS, semantic HTML and JavaScript. That does
      not mean that we do not relay on appropriate frameworks and innovative
      state of the art infrastructure where it is appropriate. With our
      strong focus on Web Performance and a resource gentle approach to software
      development, we try to use only what is strictly necessary to avoid any
      unnecessary bloat. Obviously, this should not come at the expense of
      reduced flexibility and speed in terms of “time to market”. We will provide
      you with an innovative and flexible setup which will keep you agile
      and lean at the same time.
